WELCOME TO THE XGUE DOCUMENTATION. HERE, I'LL ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT XGUE IN A SELF-ASKING MANNER

1. What is XGUE?<br />
Ans:XGUE is a roguelike template I made with VBS, which follows the Do What the Fuck You Want To Public License. Everyone can do whatever they want with it. This is just a demo. I will never release the full version.<br />

2. How to play it?<br />
Ans:Like many other computer games, it Use "a""s""w""d"to move ". That's all it can do.<br />

3. And then?<br />
Ans:That's it. I do this because I love making it. This little game took me about two days to make. I created it when I learn programing first time. In the end I hope you can learn something in it or enjoy it;)
